                        <h3>After seven years of search, a follower of Emmanuel Goldstein has been found and confessed. </h3>
                        <p>
                            A counter-revolutionary and a traitor to Big Brother has been found in a house outside the centre of London. 
                            <br><br>
                            After a long and tedious search, the Thought Police were able to enter the house, which he was illegally renting, and prevent him from doing anymore harm to the nation of Oceania.
                            <br><br>
                            The Thought Police recognise this man as an Outer Party member, Winston Smith, who has been found guilty of many ungood actions against Big Brother and Ingsoc. 
                            <br><br>
                            Once found, he was brought to the Miniluv, where he confessed to plusungood acts that could never be imagined from any citizen of Oceania.
                            <br><br>
                            The hero and lead investigator on the case of Smith, O’Brien, has given his opinion on how he was brought to justice.
                            <br><br>
                            <em>“We obviously knew that there was something unorthodox about Winston Smith, he was a counter revolutionary and it could be seen by anyone. We had been given reports from extraordinary citizens a countless times on the actions of Smith, ranging from passing out pamphlets to raping proletarian children, all of which is completely unacceptable. I led the investigation on this man which took 7 years, due to him being in contact with Emmanuel Goldstein who helped him sneak around for such a long time,”</em> 
                            <br><br>
                            He stated. 
                            In the Miniluv, Smith was found to have been <em>“a spy in the pay of the Eastasian government as far back as 1968,”</em> where he <em>“[sold] military secrets”</em> and would <em>“sabotage”</em> the government of Oceania. 
                            <br><br>
                            Additionally, Smith confessed to <em>“the distribution of seditious pamphlets”</em> and to have been a <em>“religious believer, an admirer of capitalism, and a sexual pervert,”</em> which are completely  doubleplus ungood acts.
                            <br><br>
                            Smith also confessed to having been part of an underground organisation, and stated a list of names that were part of it, one of which was his accomplice in the criminal acts, Julia Dixon.
                            <br><br>
                            The two counter-revolutionaries had met as Dixon was a prostitute, and Smith was one of her daily clients after he <em>“had murdered his wife,”</em> as he stated in his confessions. 
                            <br><br>
                            When Smith was found, he had been in a house outside the centre of London with Dixon, where they were making plans for the overthrow of Big Brother.  Luckily the Thought Police had come just on time and prevented such actions from occurring.
                            <br><br>
                            Smith and Dixon have now been undergoing trials to decide their outcome.
                            <br><br>
